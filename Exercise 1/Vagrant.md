### Instruction

 Customize your Vagrant file as necessary with private_network set to DHCP.
 
 Once the machine is up, run ifconfig and share the output in your submission along with your Vagrant file in a folder for this exercise.
 
### Solution 

In this exercise, using `Vagrant`, I successfully setup **_Ubuntu 20.04-LTS_** on my local/host machine. 

After that I customized my Vagrantfile and set my public_network to _dhcp_( Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

Then I ran ```ifconfig``` and embedded with this **README.md** is the image of the output.
